# A simple Python script that will alter Balatro's game files to be compatible with iOS!

This is intended to allow you to play Balatro on iOS, using an app such as [Love2D Studio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/love2d-studio/id6474188075?uo=4) or [Love2D Game Maker (TestFlight Link)](https://testflight.apple.com/join/bCLmQKfQ)

This script only works on the officially purchased, Steam version of Balatro. You must have paid for the game to use this script.

There are no libraries needed to run this, just run with Python 3. 

This will generate a "balatro.love" file that you can then transfer to your iDevice, and open/run it with one of the aforementioned apps.

Tested on Windows, but should be compatible with Mac and Linux as well, raise an issue if not.
